                    <li>
                        The first ancestor of the kimono was born in the Heian period (794-1192). Straight cuts of
                        fabric were sewn together to create a garment that fit every sort of body shape.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By the Edo period (1603-1868), it had evolved into a unisex outer garment called kosode. During
                        the Edo era, kosode was a visibly unifying cultural marker. Every Japanese person wore it,
                        regardless of age, gender, or socio-economic position.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It was only from the Meiji period (1868-1912) onwards that the garment was called kimono.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The design of the kimono has remained unchanged for hundreds of years. Cut into eight pieces
                        from a single length of cloth called a tanmono, the pieces are then folded and sewn together to
                        form the kimono.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The styles of women’s kimono can vary depending on age and marital status.
