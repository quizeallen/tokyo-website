                Tokyo, the bustling capital of Japan, operates under a metropolitan government system, which is akin to both a city and a prefectural government. This unique structure allows Tokyo to manage its intricate needs effectively, from urban planning to disaster management. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government, led by the Governor of Tokyo, oversees various wards, each functioning semi-autonomously, ensuring local governance is attuned to the community’s needs.
